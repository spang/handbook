# Other Types of Leaves

## Bereavement Leave
Nylas offers 3 paid days off per year for the loss of a loved one. Please coordinate your needed time with Margaret.

## Witness and Jury Duty
Witness and jury duty leave allow employees to fulfill their civic responsibilities by serving as jurors and subpoenaed witnesses up to 10 paid working days per calendar year. During that period, employees will receive the difference between their regular base pay and any payment received for their court duties. Witness and jury duty leave beyond 10 days will be unpaid, except as required by law.

## Unpaid Leave
Nylas may grant unpaid leave from time to time in extraordinary circumstances. If you need unpaid leave, please discuss with your team lead.
