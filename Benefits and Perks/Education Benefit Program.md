# Education Benefit Program

## Objective
We strongly encourage employees to pursue additional formal education to enhance their knowledge and skills! In order to do that, we've created an education benefit program that allows you to grow and learn at the company's expense.

## Details

- Each employee has $1,000 to be used annually on classes, conferences, travel, and books to benefit career growth while at Nylas.
- The minimum eligibility is six months of company service.
- An employment year is based on the employee’s anniversary.

## Example Use Cases

- Career development classes 
- Conferences
- Travel and accommodations for classes and conferences
- Communication coaching
- Educational books

## Process

- To participate, the employee must submit a request by emailing HR and their manager. HR will check the employee’s education benefit balance and the employee’s compliance with policy rules and procedures. If the employee’s application complies with policy requirements, HR will let the employee know that the benefit has been approved and the amount of the benefit. If the employee’s application is not compliant, then HR will notify the employee why.
- The employee may be reimbursed for education budget expenses only after receiving approval from HR and their manager.
- At the conclusion of an exam or course, the employee must submit a transcript, certificate of completion, or other documentation to HR to be added to the employee’s personnel file.

## Additional Rules

- Nylas will pay for a second exam only if the second exam score is higher than the prior exam score and the score received on the second exam is considered a passing score.
- Nylas will not pay for the employee to retake a course.
- Exams and courses must be taken outside of the employee’s normal work schedule.
- Approved speaking engagements related to the employee's work do not apply within this budget; Nylas will pay for travel, accommodation, and attendance in full.

The policy is a broad guideline developed by Nylas to assist with organizational decisions, but decisions regarding this benefit will be made on a case-by-case basis. Nylas will make every effort to ensure that all employees are treated fairly and equitably. Contact HR if you have any questions.
